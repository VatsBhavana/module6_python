   1)Understanding Python’s PEP 8 guidelines.
 
     Readabilty:Make your code easier to read for other.
     Consistency:Helps teams work together by following the same rule.
     Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
     Use a # for single-line comments and triple quotes for docstrings.
     Remove unnecessary spaces at the end of a line.
     Each file/module has its own namespace.Import with `import module_name'.
     

    2)Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.
      
      Indentation:-Indentation means adding spaces at the beginning of a line to show the code structure.
                   Python relies on indentation to define blocks of code. Without proper indentation, your code won’t work.

      comments:-Comments are notes in your code that Python ignores when running the program. They help explain what your code does.
                single line comment use a # symbol.triple quotes for docstrings.

      Naming Conventions:-Naming conventions are rules for naming variables, functions, classes, and constants to make your code more readable.
                          Consistent names make your code easier to understand and maintain.
                          Must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
                          Cannot start with a number.
                          Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _).

    3)Writing readable and maintainable code.
      
     Use 4-space indentation and descriptive names.
     Use Comments: Explain complex logic briefly.
     Keep Code Modular: Use functions and classes for reusability.
     Handle Errors: Use try-except for safe execution.
     Use Constants: Store fixed values in uppercase variables.
     Readable Outputs: Use f-strings for clarity.
