     1)Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops

       The break statement is used to exit the loop immediately.
       for num in range(10):
         if num == 5: # Exit the loop when num equals 5
         break  
         print(num)
 
     The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
     for num in range(10):
        if num % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
        print(num)

     Pass is Acts as a placeholder; does nothing when executed.
     for num in range(5):
       if num == 3:
           pass  # Placeholder for code
      else:
          print(num)
