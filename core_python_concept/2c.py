     input() is used to get input from the user.
     int(input()) converts the input (a string) into an integer.
     if checks if the condition (age >= 18) is true.
     if true, it prints "You are eligible for voting."Otherwise, the else block runs.
     Python is an interpreted language, which means it processes and executes code line by line.
