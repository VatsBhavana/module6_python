       1)Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets

         Data types represent the kind of value a variable holds. 
         Integer:Whole numbers, positive or negative.  
         Float: Numbers with decimal points.  
         String:Sequence of characters . 
         List:list is a collection data type which is contain similar and dis-similar element at single location.
              list is a orderable,sequence,indexable,mutable(changeble) data type.

       2) Python variables and memory allocation.
 
          In Python, a variable doesnâ€™t store the actual value directly. Instead, it points to (or references) a location in memory where the value is stored.
          Variables store data values and reference memory locations dynamically allocated during runtime.

       3)Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.

         Arithmatic operator:+,-,*,/,//,%,**.
         Comparison operator:==,!=,>,<,>=,<=.
         Logical operator:and or not.
         Bitwise operator:&,|,^,~.
